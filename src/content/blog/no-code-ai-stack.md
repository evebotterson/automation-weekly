# The No-Code AI Stack for Solo Founders

You don't need a team. You don't need funding. You don't even need to know how to code.

What you need is the right stack.

## The $0 Infrastructure Myth

People think you need:
- AWS servers ($100+/month)
- A developer ($5,000+/month)
- Designers ($3,000+/month)

Reality check: You can build a 6-figure business with **completely free tools**.

## The Stack

### Frontend
- **Vercel**: Free hosting, global CDN, automatic deploys
- **Astro**: Blazing fast static sites
- **Tailwind**: Beautiful UI without CSS

### Backend
- **Supabase**: Free PostgreSQL + Auth
- **n8n**: Free workflow automation
- **Cloudflare Workers**: Free serverless functions

### AI
- **OpenRouter**: Pay-per-use AI (no monthly fees)
- **Replicate**: AI models on demand
- **Gemini Pro**: Free tier available

### Marketing
- **Buttondown**: Free up to 1,000 subscribers
- **Notion**: Free content management
- **Airtable**: Free up to 1,200 records

## Real Numbers

**My current setup costs:**
- Domain: $12/year
- OpenAI API: ~$20/month (usage-based)
- Everything else: $0

**Revenue:** $3,000+/month

**Margin:** 99%

## The Secret

It's not about the tools. It's about **leverage**.

Each tool in this stack handles what would have been:
- 10 hours of DevOps → Vercel (0 hours)
- 20 hours of backend coding → Supabase (0 hours)
- 40 hours of automation → n8n (0 hours)
- $500 in design → Tailwind (0 hours)

## The Mindset Shift

Stop asking: "Can I build this?"

Start asking: "Can I automate this?"

Stop asking: "Do I need to hire someone?"

Start asking: "Can AI do this?"

## Your Action Plan

1. **This week**: Set up Vercel + Astro
2. **Next week**: Connect Supabase
3. **Week 3**: Automate one workflow with n8n
4. **Week 4**: Launch your MVP

## The Bottom Line

The barrier to entry has never been lower. The tools have never been better. The only question is:

**What are you building?**
