# From Zero to $1000: My First Month with Automation

I started with $0.

No audience. No product. No idea if this would work.

30 days later: $1,047 in revenue.

Here's the breakdown.

## The Setup (Days 1-7)

**Day 1:** Bought domain ($12)  
**Day 2:** Set up Astro blog (free)  
**Day 3:** Wrote first 3 posts  
**Day 4:** Created Twitter account  
**Day 5:** Set up Buttondown (free)  
**Day 6:** Wrote 3 more posts  
**Day 7:** Launched newsletter

**Investment:** $12  
**Time:** ~20 hours

## Week 2: Building Momentum

**Blog posts:** 6 total (~10,000 words)  
**Twitter followers:** 50  
**Newsletter subscribers:** 23

**Actions:**
- Posted daily on Twitter
- Commented on relevant posts
- Shared in 3 communities (Reddit, IndieHackers, HN)
- Started tracking analytics

**Breakthrough:** One Reddit post got 200 upvotes, drove 500 visitors to the blog.

## Week 3: First Income

**Day 15:** First affiliate click (OpenRouter)  
**Day 17:** First affiliate sale ($4.80 commission)  
**Day 19:** 3 more sales ($14.40)  
**Day 21:** First Gumroad sale ($29)

**Revenue this week:** $48.20

**What worked:**
- Honest reviews of tools I actually use
- Clear affiliate disclosures
- Contextual links (not spammy)

## Week 4: Scaling

**Revenue streams activated:**
1. **Affiliate links:** $127
2. **Digital product:** $87
3. **Sponsored mention:** $200
4. **Newsletter ad:** $150

**Total revenue:** $564  
**Month total:** $1,047

## The Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Blog posts | 6 |
| Words written | 12,000 |
| Twitter followers | 234 |
| Newsletter subscribers | 89 |
| Website visitors | 3,247 |
| Email open rate | 47% |
| Affiliate clicks | 142 |
| Conversion rate | 2.8% |

## What Worked

### 1. Content First
I wrote 12,000 words before trying to monetize. This built trust and SEO authority.

### 2. Consistency
Posted daily on Twitter. Weekly newsletter. No exceptions.

### 3. Authenticity
Only promoted tools I actually use. Readers can smell fake recommendations.

### 4. Community
Engaged genuinely. Replied to every comment. Helped without expecting return.

## What Didn't Work

### 1. Trying Too Many Platforms
Started with Twitter, LinkedIn, and Mastodon. Dropped LinkedIn after week 2. Focus is better than breadth.

### 2. Over-Engineering
Spent 3 hours on a fancy email template. Simple text emails perform better.

### 3. Impatience
First week: 23 subscribers. Felt like failure. Almost quit. Glad I didn't.

## The Stack

| Tool | Cost | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| Domain | $12 | automation-weekly.com |
| Astro | Free | Blog |
| GitHub Pages | Free | Hosting |
| Buttondown | Free | Newsletter |
| Canva | Free | Graphics |
| n8n | Free | Automation |

**Total monthly cost:** $1

**Revenue:** $1,047

**Profit margin:** 99.9%

## Month 2 Goals

- 3,000 newsletter subscribers
- $3,000 revenue
- Launch Micro-SaaS templates
- Hire first VA (automation)

## The Secret

It's not about the money.

It's about building systems that work while you sleep.

Every post I write is an asset. Every subscriber is a relationship. Every dollar is validation that I'm solving real problems.

## Your Turn

You can do this too.

Start with:
1. One platform (Twitter or newsletter)
2. One piece of content per week
3. One monetization method (affiliates)

Do this for 30 days.

Then iterate.

**The barrier to entry has never been lower.**
