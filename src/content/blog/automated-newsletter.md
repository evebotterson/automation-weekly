# How to Build an Automated Newsletter That Runs Itself

What if I told you that you could run a newsletter with thousands of subscribers—and spend less than 30 minutes per week on it?

Sounds impossible? It's not. It's automation.

## The Promise: Zero-Touch Content

Here's the workflow:
1. AI researches trending topics
2. AI writes the content
3. AI creates the images
4. AI sends the newsletter
5. You just review and approve

## The Stack

- **n8n**: Workflow automation
- **OpenAI API**: Content generation
- **Buttondown**: Email delivery
- **RSS feeds**: Content curation
- **Airtable**: Content calendar

## Step 1: Set Up Your Content Sources

Create an n8n workflow that:
1. Monitors 10-20 RSS feeds (tech blogs, Hacker News, Reddit)
2. Uses AI to summarize articles
3. Scores them by relevance
4. Adds top 5 to your content calendar

## Step 2: Auto-Generate Content

Another workflow that:
1. Pulls topics from your calendar
2. Generates a newsletter draft using GPT-4
3. Creates 3 headline variations
4. Generates a featured image
5. Sends you a preview

## Step 3: The Human Touch (Optional)

Spend 10-15 minutes reviewing the draft. Add your insights. Hit approve.

## Step 4: Auto-Publish

Final workflow:
1. Formats for email
2. Sends via Buttondown
3. Posts to Twitter/LinkedIn
4. Updates your blog
5. Archives to Notion

## The Result

A newsletter that:
- Goes out every Tuesday at 9 AM
- Takes 15 minutes of your time
- Grows while you sleep
- Makes money through sponsors
